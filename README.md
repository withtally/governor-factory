# Tally Factory

This package provides a factory contract for creating clones of a given implementation.

## Factory Contract

The factory contract is responsible for creating clones of a given implementation contract.

The factory contract allows for the storage and update of the implementation address, cloning of the implementation
contract using a deterministic address, initialization of the cloned contract with provided data, and prediction of the
address of a clone created with a specific implementation and salt.

1. Install the package by running `npm install tally-factory`.

   ```solidity

   ```

```bash
# run all deploy scripts in the deploy folder
npx hardhat deploy
# just implementation manager
npx hardhat deploy --tags ImplementationManager
